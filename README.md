# The CI gem helps to perform CI capability in the minimalistic approach 

CI is a gem to say consume the Quay.io posts on sucessful build completion and perform the docker operations and tests run or say perform the CI capability.

Lets say a developer checks in the code to the github. The container repository like Quay receives a call to perform the operations on building the new say Docker repo and host it. Quay can be later configured to be able to shoot out a POST call when this is done. Such call is consumed by the continuous_integration to be able to perform customized operations. Like say, destroy the local or old docker container(s). Pull the latest container(s) from the Quay. Pull the latest API or UI tests and run them against the new container(s). Finally report the test run results to the team on Slack or wherever.


### History

The idea came into picture when trying to leverage the right CI tool to help run the automated API or the UI tests. Having traversed the various industry standard CIs it was thought to anyway have a light weight CI server to help achieve the same.

### Installation and usage

To install (or update to the latest version) using the bundler gem. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'continuous_integration'
```

then run

```
bundle install
```

To install directly (without bundler), run

```
gem install continuous_integration
```

### Usage

#### Constants
Default paths have been defined in the [constants.rb](lib/continuous_integration/constants.rb) file. Update it aqccordingls as per your needs. It can also be overriden by passing them when running the server env var.

#### Running
In a console just run

```
$ continuous_integration
```

Running as a program

Put the below contents in a ruby file say `ci_server.rb`
```
#ci_server.rb

require 'continuous_integration'
server = ContinuousIntegration.setup_server
ContinuousIntegration.start_server server
```

and then run it like below to start the CI server
```
ruby ci_server.rb
```

You should be able to receive the POST requests on `http://localhost:8080` now

Also, if you access the above URL in a browser, it shows you the content of the `API_SPECS_PATH/logs` as a web server, which apparently happens to be the path of the api test tun logs generated by the aha tool 

#### Stopping the server
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to ContinuousIntegration, that's awesome, and we <3 you. There's a guide to contributing to ContinuousIntegration (both code and general help) over in [our documentation section](doc/README.md).

#### To - Do list

1. Create text file say PATHFILE when installing gem to easy fill in the constants rather than be in the code
2. Add more container hosting providers support and add tasks accordingly
3. Segregate individual tasks like tests run more seamlessly or even make them file based to give more flexibillity

#### Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the CI projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [CI code of conduct](doc/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
